	; ??? Look at IROS necessities doc for other actions, and add them here
	; test one by one

	; Next check by running with method and debug any issues with conditions expecting parameters always

	; Get a reward from this probabilistic domain

	; make deterministic version of this domain so pddl

	; run with method and get a reward from that

	; goal for tonight: compare rewards for prob and det domain

	; After: revisit simplification code (add BT conversion)
